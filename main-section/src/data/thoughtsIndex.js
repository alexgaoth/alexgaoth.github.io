This section of the website, the thoughts page, is meant to be documentation of the things that I have thought about (and usually went into deeper research for), so I can inspire others like how I was (and still) inspired.[^1]

So a *well done* to you for reading this very sentence, because you have found the only self-referential/critical article on this site.

> Okay, why is the such the case? 
You might ask

And I going to refuse to answer that question because this is not a section of *the republic*.[^2]

**However**, that doesn't mean this article is just a little Burlesque, I want to be slightly personal here and discuss my understanding of *learning* and how one should internalize their *knowledge*.

First, to define a concept, it is often clarifying to delineate what a concept is not.

Learning is not performative, or at least it shouldn't be.[^3] This performativeness can manifest in many, many ways. 
To just list a few, one could learn to gain:
- the passing of some examination requirement for a institution
- the gaining of material possession 
- the reputation and respect for their erudition 

None of these are inherently wrong, but they place the purpose of learning outside of the learner. And when the motivation is external, the learning are conformative, and tends to be shallow, temporary, just enough to pass the arbitrary threshold and then forgotten.

True learning, requires understanding and application, not just retention. The performative approach *can* result in this, but it is inefficient at best and counterproductive at worst. One would end  up with incomplete, disposable knowledge that serves the external goal and nothing else.

Of course, there exist no universal, eternal, axiomatic concept that exist with in learning. Learning, beyond from the physical change in the neurons in the brain, exist in a much nuanced, personal level. With all that said, learning to me is best when its internal, powered by the curiosity that took **us** here.

(Forgive me if this trivial description of learning seems redundant, if you are thoroughly reading this section, you probably didn't have to. But I have included it in as a rigours introduction to my actual message.)

## Necessity of a Directed Epistemic Responsibility 

> Okay, why should I listen? 
You might ask

And this time I am going to answer, because this is relevant to an idea that I hold close for the past three four years, since first I interacted with it. Soon after, I had established it a core pillar of **Gaoism**, the ideology I conveniently named after myself.[^4]

It is the idea that being knowledge should be a basic expectation of a functioning adult in society. In other words, being ignorant, actively choosing not to be more aware of the world around them, is unethical. 

When I present this ideas to others, the concept's similarity with William Clifford's [Epistemic Responsibility] and Kant's [*Sapere Aude*] gets brought up. Indeed, all our concepts push for a responsible approach to information and belief formation. On that basis, there is ideas like Civic Republicanism and Willful Ignorance (in Law) which also demands epistemic action. However, this pillar of **Gaoism** is different in the way that is a set of societal logic, a (uncompleted) moral framework for the *future*, and thus there is the crucial component of "Directionality" in the idea. 

This Directionality describes not only being able to thoroughly learn and understand the things around one, but also extend awareness to where possible. This Directionality and the idea in general is much more relevant, because **Gaosim** is for the *future* men. 

Implementation wise, there is many technical way[^5] to increase the capacity and speed of human knowledge and the gaining of it. This allow decreasing the cost to uphold ones epistemic responsibility.

But why Directionality though? Why is this new component necessary? 

Because a thorough context is what intrinsically differs us from AIs, or specifically AGIs. There is a need for redefine human to converge with the means of production, from agriculture to industrialization, we have reached the next step on this continuum.

### When we see through the fictitious part of an order/structure, our soberness makes us more loyal to the lies of this order.

Symbolic order, according to Lacan, is a system consistent by languages, law and societal norms, reinforced by oppression to build order and meaning. Though this is a simplification of his theory, this system he describes could be vividly explain the reasons behind our modern action.

So during this process of obeying this symbolic order, some parts of the order will inevitably go against the personal desire, and thus result in a surplus of desire. This is inevitable because all desires are structured by lack, never all satisfiable, thus it is impossible to be all consumed within the symbolic order.1

Thus, in order to maintain its existence, Zizek suggests symbolic order gives out a super-ego type command, to "enjoy" life. You must enjoy while under oppression by symbolic order.

According to him, while we are oppressed, we can still breathe by enjoying the surplus of desires that is not under controlled by the symbolic order.

Based on this, Zizek believes that there are two layers of the symbolic order. The first layer is the surface layer of rule, law, and manners, while there is another taboo, hidden layer below which consist of bullying (violence), restrictive/sexual content (lust), spreading secrets/rumours (jealous), but most importantly, it is rich of obscene supplement that sustains official norms.

As demanded by the symbolic order, everyone must enjoy themselves, must be happy, must be healthy, must be normal. However, it is again extremely depressing, and thus this taboo layer of the symbolic order, is what we feed off to maintain or continue to play our part in the order.

So because exposing the fiction (surface norms are backed by taboo practices) doesn't undermine the order, so instead, we knowingly participate in its "lies" through enjoyment of the little surplus, which keeps us loyal, possibly even more loyal than before.


1. Even if reached the extreme where the symbolic order covered all possible, imaginable desires there are, our desire surplus is thus gone, and would invoke the strongest of resistance.

As many of you who know me, I am a big enjoyer of this game, Europa Universalis 4. With a little shy of 2500 hours of EU4 on the clock, it would be an understatement to say it's my favourite game. As any paradox interactive fan, I also enjoy embracing the alternatives, the "what if" that could happen (Especially those things that really could have turned out either way), that would result history beyond it to be drastically different.

Now I want to bring to you one of these scenarios, picture yourself going back almost 1000 years, and land in modern day Turkey. You are Umut Çelik, a mercenary employed by the Byzantium Empire himself.

## Terms used explained:
- OTL: our timeline (the events happened in the actual history, or at least according to the available written sources)
- Themata/Thema(Greek) - the military-political regions established by Justinian
- Strategos - viceroys of a thema

## On a misty morning in the fields of Manzikert...
Umut Çelik woke up to the ground violently shaking. Around him were his comrades in his company, scouring up from their mass tents, gathering at the abrupting shouts from their commanders. An uneasy feeling arose from within him, he knew exactly why the grounds were shaking, it was as if it was carved into his genetics – thousands of war horses charging into a fight.

Umut knew the day that his company marched eastward that he was going to be faced against his blood-related kin, but he didn't know this day would come so soon, so suddenly, so.. violently.

Arrow rained into the camp before Umut could even contemplate further, and as he reached for his mail, his right hand was torn away from him. A great, piercing pain followed, as Umut found an arrow through his right palm, pinning it to the ground. The adrenaline followed pulled the arrow out for him, as he returned to his mail and grabbed his saber, and followed his company out the camp grounds.

Thousands of horses as he imagined confronted his company, along with the varangians and the empire's theme troops, in total 20 thousand strong. Umut's side out numbers the army across them, as they are same in width but far sparse in formation.

Umut looks closely at the enemy: The ones on the wings are close, while the centre ones with Alp Arlsan's flag sit farther away. This is the crescent formation, Umut thought to himself, as a charging horn blew behind him. Rushing, Umut unsheaths his saber, waving it towards horse archers pulling away.

This the *parthian tactic*, the age-old tactic, as Umut thought to himself as the gap between the armies only grew farther apart. But before most of his comrades could make the same observation, another army in purple appeared over the hills behind the enemy.

It has to be Tarchaniotes' army, another 20 thousand strong, even without seeing the banners, Umut knew that this battle was going to conclude soon – his kins has ran out of space to retreat.

This is what COULD possibly happen at the Battle of Manzikert, and it is a section of alternative history that I have been stretching further down in the river of history.

So the direct result of the Empire's victory in this battle would result in the turkic incursion in Anatolia to stop, as Alp Arslan (if still hasn't died yet, all things considered he was assassinated a year later in OTL anyways) loses his authority and muslim allies through his resounding defeat. The remaining turkic population, without a regime to protect them and religious fluidity, would likely convert to the Orthodox and bow to the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople, assimilated into the Empire like the various "south-slavs" in the Balkans. Umut the mercenary, is more than likely to be one of them, and take up a more permanent position in the Empire's militia.

Albeit Byzantium's victory, it still had such a long list of issues, which the most significant are: Eroding theme systems, political instability and autonomy, debased coinage and growing inflation, but as the major exterior threat in the east defeated, the Empire can focus back on to these issues. Though alexios komnenos won't therefore have the chance to usurp the throne through the Empire's chaos in OTL, Romanos and the Diogenes family managed to centralise power through the support of these newly gained citizens of the Empire (the converted turks), as they deem Romanos as a powerful figure through victory at Manzikert.
The support of these new citizens could come through violence, or simply politics in Constantinople, but nevertheless Romanos has tilted the balance of power within the Empire, enabling him to disarm the Ducas family, reform the thema, by removing strategos that are becoming like feudal lords and replacing them by general-aristocrats from the capital.

I recognize what Romanos was able to do in the past paragraph is possibly more implausible than the victory at Manzikert itself, but rather than praising Romano and his ability that he never showed in OTL, I am hypothesizing a more stable Empire in the few decades following the battle. (So yes I am considering a rather large group of alternative timelines rather than just *Romanos wins at Manzikert*. But why Romanos? why Manzikert? Simply that it is among one of the most plausible alternatives that would bring this inner stability). Continue reading to see why this stability or even thrive of the Empire is significant.

Now with a strong Byzantium influence maintained in east Anatolia and north Levant and zero to none nomadic forces, the first crusader would be even more successful than it was in its history. This is not to say that all Seljuk forces would not exist, but large, independent nomadic forces would be hard to continue to thrive in this area which they can not control.

The Crusade even more success could be attributed to the weaker muslim armies, unable to fight as an organized army, the muslim conscripts through secular power or Jihadist through religious authority would lose badly to the crusaders. (Just like the sixth crusade but the way around).

The successful Crusade attracted a great inflow of European Christians, much greater than it was in history, as the Levant is pictured as a land of riches, of opportunity, of religious pilgrimage and duty. Some might have even called it at the time: **"The Levantine Dream."**

The further implications of this alternative timeline goes far beyond, but now I am returning to do some more reading to see what Christian influence further east into the old world would stir up the timeline.

# Chinese Nationalization Modernization is Actually Quite Interesting

The story of Chinese modernization presents one of history's most fascinating paradoxes: how do you simultaneously invent and defend a national identity? Chinese intellectuals of the late 19th and early 20th centuries found themselves in this exact predicament, forced to conceptualize China as a modern nation-state while desperately protecting it from foreign encroachment.

## The Double Bind of Modernization

Unlike Western nations that had centuries to develop their national identities organically, China faced what we might call a "modernization speedrun" - an accelerated process born out of necessity rather than natural evolution. The Opium Wars (1839-1842, 1856-1860) had shattered China's traditional worldview and forced a reckoning with Western power.

Chinese intellectuals like Liang Qichao, Yan Fu, and later figures like Chen Duxiu found themselves caught between two impossible demands:

### First struggle they had: Creating National Identity
- **Defining "China"**: What exactly was China? An empire? A civilization? A race? The traditional concept of "All under Heaven" (tianxia) didn't translate to modern geopolitics, it is barely even a geographical definition.
- Imagining the Nation: Benedict Anderson's concept of "imagined communities" becomes particularly relevant here - China had to be imagined as a nation before it could be defended as one
- Cultural Renaissance: The New Culture Movement attempted to define Chinese modernity while preserving cultural essence

### Second struggle they had: Defending Against Encroachment
- Territorial Integrity: Foreign concessions, spheres of influence, and extraterritorial rights were carving up Chinese sovereignty
- Economic Independence: The unequal treaties and foreign control of customs created economic dependency, through means of national/international banks and corperations owning railroads, customs etc...
- Cultural Resistance: Missionaries and Western education challenged traditional Confucian values, the "shame" vs "guilty" way of judging. (there will a future section on this)

# The Future of AI Agents

The current AI landscape is dominated by transformers, and everyone seems convinced this architecture will define artificial intelligence for the foreseeable future. But history suggests otherwise. When a technology becomes subject to incremental refinements under intense competition, it often signals that a paradigm shift is approaching—even if that shift takes decades to fully materialize.

## The Pattern of Technological Succession

### The CNN Era and Its Decline
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) once seemed unshakeable. From AlexNet's breakthrough in 2012 to ResNet's innovations in 2015, CNNs dominated computer vision. The incremental improvements—batch normalization, skip connections, attention mechanisms—seemed to promise endless progress.

But by 2017, the Vision Transformer (ViT) papers began showing that transformers could match or exceed CNN performance on image tasks. The writing was on the wall, even though many refused to read it.

### Pre-Transformer Architectures
Before transformers, we had:
- RNNs and LSTMs: Dominated sequence modeling until attention mechanisms made them obsolete
- Encoder-Decoder Architectures: Powerful but limited by their sequential nature
- Convolutional Sequence Models: Attempts to parallelize sequence processing

Each seemed revolutionary until the next paradigm emerged.

## Signs That Transformer Dominance May Be Waning

### Diminishing Returns on Scale
The returns on simply making transformers larger are showing clear signs of diminishing marginal utility:

- Parameter Scaling: GPT-3 to GPT-4 required massive increases in parameters for modest performance gains
- Compute Costs: Training costs are growing exponentially while improvements are becoming linear
- Data Limitation*: High-quality training data is becoming scarce, forcing models to train on synthetic or lower-quality data

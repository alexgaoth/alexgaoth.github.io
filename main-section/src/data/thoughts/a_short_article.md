# An short article to describe this website

This section of the website, the thoughts page, is meant to be documentation of the things that I have thought about (and usually went into deeper research for), so I can inspire others like how I was (and still) inspired.[^1]

So a *well done* to you for reading this very sentence, because you have found the only self-referential/critical article on this site.

> Okay, why is the such the case? 
You might ask

And I going to refuse to answer that question because this is not a section of *the republic*[^2].

**However**, that doesn't mean this article is just a little Burlesque, I want to be slightly personal here and discuss my understanding of *learning* and how one should internalize their *knowledge*.

First, any performative means to learn, is wrong [^3]. This performativeness can manifest in many, many ways. 
To just list a few, one could learn to gain:
- the passing of some examination requirement for a institution
- the gaining of material possession 
- the reputation and respect for their erudition 

Learning, to me, is best when its internal, powered by the curiosity that took **us** here.

Okay, why should I listen? 
You might ask

And this time I am going to answer, because this is relevant to an idea that I hold close for the past three four years, since first I interacted with it. Soon after, I had established it a core pillar of **Gaoism**, the ideology I conveniently named after myself[^4].

It is the idea that being knowledge should be a basic expectation of a functioning adult in society. In other words, being ignorant, actively choosing not to be more aware of the world around them, is unethical.

[^1]: Consider this a disclaimer.
[^2]: Hence, me the writer, get to ignore all the questions I want.
[^3]: I know it's blunt, but let me cook.
[^4]: Cause I can, and many found it funny then. Now thinking of it again, let hope they were laughing with me not at me.

### When we see through the fictitious part of an order/structure, our soberness makes us more loyal to the lies of this order.

Symbolic order, according to Lacan, is a system consistent by languages, law and societal norms, reinforced by oppression to build order and meaning. Though this is a simplification of his theory, this system he describes could be vividly explain the reasons behind our modern action.

So during this process of obeying this symbolic order, some parts of the order will inevitably go against the personal desire, and thus result in a surplus of desire. This is inevitable because all desires are structured by lack, never all satisfiable, thus it is impossible to be all consumed within the symbolic order.1

Thus, in order to maintain its existence, Zizek suggests symbolic order gives out a super-ego type command, to "enjoy" life. You must enjoy while under oppression by symbolic order.

According to him, while we are oppressed, we can still breathe by enjoying the surplus of desires that is not under controlled by the symbolic order.

Based on this, Zizek believes that there are two layers of the symbolic order. The first layer is the surface layer of rule, law, and manners, while there is another taboo, hidden layer below which consist of bullying (violence), restrictive/sexual content (lust), spreading secrets/rumours (jealous), but most importantly, it is rich of obscene supplement that sustains official norms.

As demanded by the symbolic order, everyone must enjoy themselves, must be happy, must be healthy, must be normal. However, it is again extremely depressing, and thus this taboo layer of the symbolic order, is what we feed off to maintain or continue to play our part in the order.

So because exposing the fiction (surface norms are backed by taboo practices) doesn't undermine the order, so instead, we knowingly participate in its "lies" through enjoyment of the little surplus, which keeps us loyal, possibly even more loyal than before.


1. Even if reached the extreme where the symbolic order covered all possible, imaginable desires there are, our desire surplus is thus gone, and would invoke the strongest of resistance.
